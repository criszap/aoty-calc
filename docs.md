# First Stage

1. Using Python because C++ can't handle non-ascii characters (Ã« breaks it) to calculate score from the text.

2. Text gets read directly from the file and the score gets calculated and printed back as well as other data.

3. Text gets formatted to match my AOTY list format and printed back

4. After basic logic is done ill edit it so it just reads the file whenever I run the program.

# Second Stage
- JS that imports tracks from AOTY.org into the file based on the artist and album

- JS that places data into AOTY.org

- find a way to connect the first / second stage (API?)

- make the text reader smarter
    - /* anywhere in moosic.txt means ignore everything after it
    - ...

# Future... 
- include UI / turn it into a webapp (probably w full JS)
- deploy it on github pages
- add more stuff in the future...
